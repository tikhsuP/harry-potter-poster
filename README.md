# Augmented Reality: Moving Images in the Harry Potter movie series

Remember the Harry Potter movies?
Remember the way printed images move in the movie? 
Ofcourse, in the movie, it is done using white magic but we can achieve similar results in real life using Augmented Reality.

In this project, I have built an AR app with Unity & Vuforia which brings the image to life, just like the images/newspapers/banners/posters in the Harry Potter movie series.
You will be able to see the images move when you scan the target image with your phone.
